# Variables

A few variables accessible in swup instance that could be helpful.

## transition

Holds information about latest transition in a form of object.
Variable is always set right at the beginning of transition (after `loadPage` method call) so it can be used further on.

```javascript
swup.transition = {
    from: 'homepage',   // route of previous page
    to: 'docs',         // route of next page
    custom: 'slide-in'  // content 'data-swup-transition' attribute or content of customTransition property passed to loadPage method
}
```

## options

Holds currently set options after merging set options.

## scrollToElement

Holds id of element that swup needs to scroll to after content replace (`href="/docs#this_is_scrollToElement"`).

## plugins

Array of all plugin instances currently enabled on swup.
