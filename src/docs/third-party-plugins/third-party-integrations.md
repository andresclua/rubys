# Third-Party Plugins

These are plugins that swup users have created themselves. Keep in mind that these are
external projects and any questions or issues need to be directed at the authors directly.

To have your plugin listed here, create an issue or a PR on the
[swup docs](https://github.com/swup/swup) repository.
