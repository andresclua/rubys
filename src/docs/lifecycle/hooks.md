# Hooks

Swup provides a variety of hooks that allow listening to lifecycle events, customizing the
transition process as well as triggering custom logic at specific points.

## Registering handlers

You can register hooks on swup's `hooks` registry. All handlers receive the global
[context object](/context/) as their first argument.

```javascript
// Log to the console on each page view
swup.hooks.on('page:view', (context) => {
  console.log('New page loaded:', context.to.url);
});
```

### Handler options

Pass in an options object to customize how a handler is invoked.

#### once

Execute the handler once, then remove it.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {}, { once: true });
```

#### before

Execute the handler before the internal default handler.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('content:replace', () => {}, { before: true });
```

#### replace

Replace the internal default handler entirely with a custom function.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('fetch:request', () => {}, { replace: true });
```

#### priority

Influence the order in which this handler is run in relation to other handlers for the same hook,
regardless of order of registration. The default priority is `0` â€” negative values make the handler
execute earlier, positive values make it execute later.

```javascript
// Execute before other handlers
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {}, { priority: -100 });

// Execute after other handlers
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {}, { priority: 100 });
```

#### Shortcuts

There are shortcuts available for common handler options:

```javascript
swup.hooks.once('page:view', () => {}); // once: true
swup.hooks.before('content:replace', () => {}); // before: true
swup.hooks.replace('fetch:request', () => {}); // replace: true
```

## Pausing execution

Swup will await Promises returned from handlers, allowing you to pause execution.

```javascript
// Delay the start of the page transition by 1 second
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {
  return new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000));
});
```

This means that `async/await` handlers are supported as well:

```javascript
// Wait for a custom function before starting the transition
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', async () => {
  await myCustomFunction();
});
```

> **Note** Some hooks are executed without awaiting Promises if their handler needs
to prevent a DOM event's default action: `link:click` and `history:popstate`.

## Removing handlers

Remove a previously registered handler by passing in the function to remove.

```javascript
const handler = () => console.log('New page loaded');

// Register a handler
swup.hooks.on('page:view', handler);

// Remove it again later
swup.hooks.off('page:view', handler);
```

## List of hooks

The following hooks are exposed by swup and can be accessed as such:

<div class="events-table" data-table-with-anchor-links>

|        Hook name        |                                         Description                                         |

</div>

## Examples

### Trigger analytics page views

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {
  dataLayer.push({
    event: 'VirtualPageview',
    virtualPageURL: window.location.pathname,
    virtualPageTitle: document.title
  });
});
```

### Initialize new components on the page

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {
  if (document.querySelector('#carousel')) {
    const carousel = new Carousel('#carousel');
  }
});
```

## DOM events

All hooks are also triggered on the `document` with a `swup:` prefix. They receive the hook name
and the global context object inside the detail key of the event.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('swup:page:view', ({ detail: { context } }) => {
  console.log('Going to', context.to.url);
});
```

## Custom hooks

Plugin authors might want to create and trigger new hooks to implement additional functionality.

See the [Custom Hooks](/plugins/create-plugin/#custom-hooks) section of the Create a Plugin page
for details.
