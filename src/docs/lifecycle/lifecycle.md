# Lifecycle

Swup handles the complete lifecycle of a page visit: it will intercept link clicks, load the new
page in the background, replace the content and animate between the old and the new page.

- Use [hooks](/hooks/) to trigger custom logic
- Manipulate the [context object](/context/) to customize how swup will transition to the next page
