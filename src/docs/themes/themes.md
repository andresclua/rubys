# Themes

Themes are predefined transitions to get up and running quickly.

Technically, they are identical to plugins in how they're structured and used, but with a focus on adding required CSS and manipulating HTML if necessary.

Try out the default themes here:

<div class="theme-selector">
    <label><input type="radio" name="theme" value="FadeTheme"> Fade theme</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="theme" value="SlideTheme"> Slide theme</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="theme" value="OverlayTheme"> Overlay theme</label>
</div>
