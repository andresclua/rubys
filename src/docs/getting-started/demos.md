# Demos

Looking for a demo of swup animations in action? You are in fact looking at one! These docs are built
with swup and CSS-only page transitions. See below for more isolated examples showcasing swup's
features and options.

Click the <img src="https://replit.com/badge?theme=dark&variant=small&caption=Try"> button
of each demo to see the code and fork it for experimenting yourself.

<!-- <div class="demo">
  <div class="fake-browser">

      <div class="action-btns">
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
      </div>
      <div class="address-bar">
        swup-demo-basic.philippdaun.repl.co
      </div>
      <div class="setting-more">
