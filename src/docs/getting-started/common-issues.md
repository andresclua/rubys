# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

This is a compilation of challenges and suggested solutions when integrating or extending swup.

## Scripts on the next page are not executed

Swup doesn't insert new script tags by default. To run code after a page visit, you have a few
options that are explained in the section on [Reloading Scripts](/getting-started/reloading-javascript/).

- [Trigger custom code](/getting-started/reloading-javascript/#triggering-custom-code) using hooks
- Use the [Head Plugin](/plugins/head-plugin/) to insert new scripts into the head
- Use the [Scripts Plugin](/plugins/scripts-plugin/) to run existing and new scripts in head or body

## Stylesheets of the next page are not loaded

Swup doesn't automatically update the contents of the `head` tag. Any stylesheets not included in
the current page's `head` will not be loaded. The easiest solution is to use a single stylesheet
for the whole website.

If your site does require modular stylesheets per section or template, use the
[Head Plugin](/plugins/head-plugin/) to add the new stylesheets and configure its `awaitAssets`
option to also wait for those stylesheets to finish loading before animating in the new page.

## Current and next page are not visible at the same time

Out of the box, swup will completely hide the previous page, replace the content and only then
show the next page. The old and new containers are never in the DOM at the same time.

You can however use the official [Parallel Plugin](/plugins/parallel-plugin/) to run both the in
and out animations in parallel. It will keep a copy of the previous content around for the duration
of the whole transition.

## Screen readers are not informed about updated content

We're dynamically updating parts of the page, so it's recommended to let screen readers announce
changes to its content. While you can add the `aria-live="polite"` to content containers yourself,
it's recommended to use the official [Accessibility Plugin](/plugins/a11y-plugin/) which makes this
very easy to implement. It reads out the title of the new document to screen readers, requiring no
change to your markup. It will also focus the main content area for improved keyboard accessibility.

## Scroll anchors are too close to the top of the viewport

When jumping to an anchor on the page, the browser will scroll the page so that the targeted
element will appear at the top of the viewport. The top part of the page might however already be
covered with other content like a header. Effectively, we need a way to tell the browser to scroll
to an offset point slightly above the anchor to compensate for the content on top of it.

In modern browsers, this is easily done via CSS:

```css
scroll-margin-top: var(--header-height, 100px);
```

If you need fine-grained control over this, consider installing the
[scroll plugin](/plugins/scroll-plugin/) which has a dedicated `offset` option to handle these
cases.

## History navigations are ignored & never update the page

Swup is designed to manage only the history entries it has generated itself. This approach allows
for custom development, where you can create and manage your own history entries without
interference from swup. However, if your site's scripts are creating or modifying history entries
and you want swup to handle them, consider these two strategies:

- Use swup's [history helpers](/api/helpers/#createhistoryrecord) for creating history entries it will recognize
- Configure swup to [accept all history entries](/options/#skippopstatehandling)

Swup may also ignore certain history navigations if your [link selector](/options/#linkselector)
doesn't include all page links. In such cases, the browser will process these links independently,
creating history entries that swup does not recognize and will not handle.

## Overflowing containers get reset on navigation

Replacing a swup container will also reset its scroll position. There might be cases where you
want the content to be updated but the scroll position to be kept, like an overflowing sidebar
navigation that needs to mark the currently active nav item with a class name.

Consider using the [Morph Plugin](https://github.com/daun/swup-morph-plugin) for such
cases. It lets you define additional containers that morph their new content into the old element,
without a complete replacement and without resetting the scroll position of the container itself.

## Canonical link tag causes indexing issues

Swup doesn't automatically update the contents of the `head` tag â€” it only updates the document
`title`. This can lead to issues with wrong canonical links appearing in search results since search
engines these days simulate actual devices with enabled JS for crawling websites.

The official way to solve this is using the [head-plugin](/plugins/head-plugin/) which will
update the head tag on each visit. To tackle this at the root level, consider using XML sitemaps to
index your site.

## A library already uses `transition-*` classes

Some third-party libraries like [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) might already be using
class names like `transition-*` for their own functionality. In this case, swup will try to wait
for animations on those elements, quite possibly messing up the timing of animations.

Using a stricter [animation selector](/options/#animationselector) fixes the issue.

```javascript
var swup = new Swup({
  animationSelector: '[class*="swup-transition-"]'
});
```

```html
<main id="swup" class="swup-transition-fade"></main>
```

```css
html.is-changing .swup-transition-fade {
  transition: 0.4s;
  opacity: 1;
}
html.is-animating .swup-transition-fade {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

## Overused `transition-*` classes

Swup will wait for any element with a `transition-*` class to finish animating.
While there is an unlimited number of elements that can have this class, only one is actually
required for swup to get its timing right. Using it on all animated elements is not required and
often leads to bugs.

It is recommended to use one element with a `transition-*` class to set the animation duration and
make any other animations happen independently. As long as all animations share the same duration,
there should be no issues with this approach.

```css
/* Note: no transition-* prefix */
html.is-changing .logo {
  transition: 0.4s;
  opacity: 1;
}
html.is-animating .logo {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

## Escaped characters inside `<noscript>`

Some browsers (Safari, older versions of IE) escape characters inside of `noscript` tags when placed
into the DOM with `element.innerHTML` as swup does. That is usually not an issue unless the contents
of the `noscript` tags are further used in your JavaScript code. If that's the case, the characters
need to be unescaped with [regex replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace),
a pretty creative way using `textarea` mentioned [in this thread](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/107)
or in any other way.

See [this issue](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/107) for more information.

## The browser performs a hard visit instead of a swup transition

A hard page visit can be caused by various issues. These are the most common scenarios and suggested steps to solve them:

1. There is a [containers](https://swup.js.org/options/#containers) mismatch between the old and the new page

   - In your browser console, activate the option "Preserve Log" and see if there are any errors being thrown as you navigate

2. You have told swup to [ignore the visit](https://swup.js.org/options/#ignorevisit)

   - Check if you have customized `ignoreVisit`. If so, see if it helps to disable it.
   - Check if the link or any of its parent elements has the attribute `data-no-swup`

3. The propagation of the click event is [being stopped](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/236#issuecomment-1203786475) and thus never reaches swup

   - Check if on the link that doesn't trigger a swup visit you are [stopping the event propagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)
